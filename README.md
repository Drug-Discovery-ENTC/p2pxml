# P2PXML: Deep Geometric Framework to Predict Antibody-Antigen Binding Affinity

[Paper Link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.09.598103v1) | [Project page for P2PXML](https://drug-discovery-entc.github.io/p2pxml/)

## Data

The link for our curated dataset (P2PXML) can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/11531319).
Example PDB files for Colab demonstration can be found [here](https://github.com/Drug-Discovery-ENTC/p2pxml/tree/main/data).

## Colab Minimal Demonstration

The link for minimal demonstration for predicting binding affinity using the proposed combined model is on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pDAU2Jizu3kZ2skybhhb45UcBJ2skYxY?usp=sharing).

## Results

<img src="https://github.com/Drug-Discovery-ENTC/p2pxml/blob/main/resources/scatter2.png" width="960" height="540"><br />
log10(IC50) of the predicted values vs log10(IC50) of the target values for the test set of P2PXML-PDB dataset using our best performing model. The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.8703 and the Spearman’s correlation coefficient is 0.9450 between the predicted and target values.
